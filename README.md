Simple project to test bootstrap and a few other technologies I was learning.
Is hosted at A-J-C.github.io, but some functionality has become outdated and so doesn't work (the three buttons).

This repo is for personal use and so isn't set-up for someone forking the code, however if interested please contact me at alexcraig.linkedin@gmail.com
